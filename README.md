# 🌸 DermaGlow AI – Skincare Analysis Web App

DermaGlow AI is a browser-based skincare analysis application that uses computer vision and AI to analyze facial skin conditions in real time and provide personalized skincare recommendations.

The app captures a live camera feed, detects the face using MediaPipe, and sends an image snapshot to an AI vision model for skincare insights such as skin type, visible concerns, and a simple routine.
